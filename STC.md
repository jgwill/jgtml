@STCIssue MLFCLI cleanup and Update

* All patterns are dealt with : realityhelper.generate_mlf_feature_patter

Usage:
-pn PATTERNNAME (Must have been created in TTF before)
>jgtttfcli ... -pn PATTERNNAME -clm COLUMN1 COLUMN2 COLUMN3

Future action :   

* Extend to support the creation of Patterns :  
>--create_pattern PATTERNNAME COLUMN1 COLUMN2 COLUMN3
 - That would run jgtmlfcli to create data
 - Patterns and their corresponding Columns data could be centralized  (or maybe deal with managing pattern with different CLI  (jgtmlpatternmanagercli.py !!)

```

### acronyms and meaning of columns

| namespace | title | notes | Refacto |
| --------- | ----- | ---------- | --- |
| sig_ | Signal | Mean its about signal. | Is it relevant to add it as it is implied ?? |
| tmopen | Tide Mouth is Open | | |

Suggest refactoring of columns names considering these notes:

* We have a value for all the signals (unfilltered)
* We have a value with basic filtering (signal is not in regular balance lines lips and teeth)
* We have the Tide Alligator measuring 2 larger degree filtering various columns with filtering such as  the Tide Mouth is open + the signal is in the tide lips or in the tide teeth


Here's a Markdown table that describes each type of signal:

| signal_name | description | notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| all_signals | This signal type includes all signals generated by the "Tide" indicator. | This is the most general signal type and includes all other signal types. |
| sig_mouth_is_open | This signal type includes signals generated when the "Tide" mouth is open. | The "Tide" mouth is considered open when the lips, teeth, and jaw lines are fanned out in a certain way. |
| sig_not_in_lips_teeth | This signal type includes signals that are not within the "Tide" lips or teeth. | Signals within the lips or teeth are typically considered less reliable. |
| sig_is_in_tteeth_sum | This signal type includes signals that are within the "Tide" teeth. | Signals within the teeth are typically considered more reliable. |
| sig_in_tlips_tmouth_is_open | This signal type includes signals when the "Tide" mouth is open and the signal is within the lips. | This is a more specific signal type that combines the conditions of "mouth_is_open" and "sig_in_tlips". |
| sig_tide_m_open_in_tteeth_sum | This signal type includes signals when the "Tide" mouth is open and the signal is within the teeth. | This is a more specific signal type that combines the conditions of "mouth_is_open" and "sig_is_in_tteeth_sum". |


### names b4 refactoring

| sig_namespace | title | notes | refacto |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| mouth_is_open | Regular Mouth is Open | | sig_mouth_is_open |
| not_in_lips_teeth | Signal not in Mouth | Signal not in regular Mouth (lips/teeth) | sig_not_in_mouth |
| sig_is_in_bteeth_sum | | | sig_is_in_bteeth_sum |
| sig_in_blips_bmouth_is_open | | | sig_bmopen_in_blips_sum |
| big_m_open_in_bteeth_sum | | | sig_bmopen_in_bteeth_sum |

### REVIEW
* All Big Alligator signals are based on the 'mouth_is_open'/'not_in_lips_teeth' which is ok but we might want a variation where the signal is not in the Mouth but the 'Mouth is Not open' (the marker oscillate on that timeframe).

### Desired result points
* mfi signals
* tide alligator filtering (reproduce experimentation of the big alligator) -> --@STCGoal Insights of Larger Timeframes
